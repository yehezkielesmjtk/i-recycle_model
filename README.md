# i-recycle_model

In this project we use a dataset from Kaggle which contains images of garbage divided into 12 classes to classify the types of waste. 

Dataset resource: https://www.kaggle.com/mostafaabla/garbage-classification

We use Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. To improve our machine learning model we use transfer learning. We chose to use a pre-trained model for image classification, namely InceptionV3.
